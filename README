Optimum Threshold 

This is a program to find optimum threshold from a given text file which has the gray value of pixels stored in it. The file is given as arguments from command line to the program. 
This program uses two approches to find optimum threshold - iterative and histogram also known as hashing method.The second method is more efficient and faster

The executable files are stored in the bin folder under the name "optimum_threshold.out"

The headerfiles are stored in include

The sourcecode can be read from src folder

The results of the calculations for optimum threshold are stored in results for each method seperately along with graphs

The raw data i.e. text files with gray values are stored in data/txt folder
